## [SQL](SQL)
  
Dataset - [Student-scores.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xaTo6yFWRzmZXO3HEvTnwnIykI-y5L4K/view?usp=sharing)
  
Use the CSV file and create the tables in SQL and then try to solve the questions mentioned below.

1)Calculate the average math_score for each career_aspiration. Order the results by the average score in descending order.

2)Find the career_aspirations that have an average english_score greater than 75. Display the career aspiration and the average score.

3)Identify students who have a math_score higher than the school's average math score. List their first_name, last_name, and math_score.

4)Rank students within each career_aspiration category by their physics_score in descending order. Display the first_name, last_name, career_aspiration, physics_score, and the rank.

5)For each student, create a new column full_name by concatenating first_name and last_name with a space in between. Show the full_name and email columns where the email contains the string "academy".

6)Calculate the lowest (FLOOR), highest (CEIL), and average (ROUND to two decimal places) chemistry_score for each career aspirant. Display the career aspirants, lowest score, highest score, and average score.

7)Find career aspirations where the average history_score is above 85 and at least 5 students aspire to that career. List the career_aspiration and the average score.

8)Identify students who score above average in both biology and chemistry, compared to the school's average for those subjects. Display their id, first_name, last_name, biology_score, and chemistry_score.

9)Calculate the percentage of absence days for each student relative to the total absence days recorded for all students. Display the id, first_name, last_name, and the calculated percentage, rounded to two decimal places. Order the results by the percentage in descending ord

10)Identify students who have scores above 80 in at least three out of the six subjects: math, history, physics, chemistry, biology, and English. Display their id, first_name, last_name, and the count of subjects where they scored above 80.

## [Tableau](Tableau)
- [Task 1](Task-1): Sales

 Involves creating a dashboard in Tableau that showcases sales data by product sub-categories and geographic distribution. The steps include:

 1)Establish a relationship between the Orders, People, and Returns datasets.
  
 2)Generate a bar chart displaying the sales performance of the top 10 product sub-categories.
  
 3)Develop a map chart that visualizes the sales volume across different states.
  
 4)Compile a dashboard that incorporates both the bar and map charts. Configure interactive filters to allow users to select a product sub-category from the bar chart, which in turn updates the map chart to reflect sales data specific to that sub-category in various states.

- [Task-2](Task-2): TestMatches
 
1)Career Span vs Total Runs: A scatter plot showing each player's career span against their total runs could highlight longevity versus performance. Create a calculated field to find players' career spans.

2)Create a heatmap chart distinguishing the players based on their average if the average is greater than 45 then prolific scorer, if greater than 35 then consistent scorers and if less than that then emerging talent also make a calculated field to distinguish them on bases of there strike rate, if strike rate greater than 70 then hard hitters like this only takes a player who started their careers after 2008.

3)Fours and Sixes Comparison: A bubble chart comparing the number of fours (Fours column) and sixes (Sixes column) hit by players, sized by the total 4s and colored by the 6s scored. This could help visualize the aggressiveness of players.

4)Create a treemaps chart showcasing players who have hit the most hundreds, and who debut after 2010.

## Machine Learning
Dataset - Loan
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-5kRQ4TGSJRU_hKCFGWDNd9NNbRRewr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106512624777490251693&rtpof=true&sd=true

Load the Loan dataset and perform the initial preprocessing steps, filling in the missing values for both categorical and numerical columns. Then apply one-hot encoding to the categorical variables and check for outliers in the numerical columns. Following this, Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train a Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN & Decision Tree Classifier, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
